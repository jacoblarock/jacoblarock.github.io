<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<br><br>
<p>My name is Jacob. I am currently working in the data team at the Buhl Data Service GmbH.</p>
<p>Originally from Washington, USA, I grew up and went to school in various cities in Colorado. In
   2021. I moved to the city of Siegen, Germany for university and have been living here since
   then.</p>
<p>I am excited by technology and am always ready to learn something new, be it for work, uni or
   just for myself. Aside from that, I can also be frequently found outside hiking, inside reading
   or generally enjoying a good coffee.</p>
<p>This site is a small summary of me as a person and the things which I have achieved.</p>
