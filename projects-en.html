<h3>Thesis: Interpretable Deepfake Voice Detection: A Hybrid Deep-Learning Model and
   Explanation Evaluation</h3>
<p>This project, my bachelor thesis, focuses on explainable AI (XAI) in the space of audio
   deepfake detection. I developed a novel model architecture that is especially capable of
   combining features of diverse dimensionalities into a single end-classification and generating
   feature-based explanations. Aside from that, I also introduce two new metrics in this work, in
   order to evaluate the quality of the metrics produced by the model in an objective and
   mathematical manner. The work was presented at the 2025 Explainable AI World Conference and was
   published in the CEUR Workshop 
   <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-4017/#paper_13">
      Proceedings
   </a>. Additionally, the work was published under the

      selected theses

   by the University of Siegen.<br>

<h3>Expansion and Rebuild of the Reporting System at LapID</h3>
<p>For the purpose of automation of the reporting at LapID Service GmbH, I worked together with the
   DevOps to rewrite and expand export queries and establish a connection from Azure in PowerBI
   such that evaluations and report generation no longer had to be done manually. Aside from that,
   the expansions to the data available made new evaluations possible that were not possible
   before.</p>

<h3>Chroma_Llama</h3>
<p>A simple implementation of a query pipeline to answer questions based on documents stored in a
   vector database. Makes use of the vector database ChromaDB and the LLM library Ollama.

<h3>Paper: A Comprehensive Review on Audio Deepfake Detection with an Emphasis on
    Explainability</h3>
<p>This paper focuses on assessing the current state of explainability in the area of audio
   deepfake detection and provides a comprehensive view into the domain, with the result that
   explainability is not yet implemented as much as it should be and is not yet mature, but that
   the potential exists through features that I identified in the paper that could possibly be
   understood better by people.<br>

<h3>Market analysis including customer and competition analysis for Webtron GbR</h3>
<p>This project was completed as a consulting project for the Study & Consult eV, completed with
   two other members in 2023. According to a survey performed at the end of the project, the
   customer's expectations were exceeded, and the results were realistic and usable.</p>

<h3>Practice Cards</h3>
<p>This is a simple web-app written with Python using Flask in addition to HTML and CSS paired with
   Bootstrap as well as pure JavaScript. See the
   <a href="https://github.com/jacoblarock/practicecards">repository</a> for more.</p>
