<h3>Explainable Detection of Audio Deepfakes</h3>
<p>This project, my bachelor thesis, focuses on the implementation of an audio deepfake detection
   model capable of generating explanations using Lime. Evaluations on the In-the-Wild Dataset
   result in an accuracy of over 94% or a minimal EER of under 0.04.<br>

<h3>Paper: A Comprehensive Review on Audio Deepfake Detection with an Emphasis on
    Explainability</h3>
<p>This paper focuses on assessing the current state of explainability in the area of audio
   deepfake detection and provides a comprehensive view into the are, with the result that
   explainability is not yet implemented as much as it should be and is not yet mature, but that
   the potential exists through features that I identified in the paper that could possible be
   understood better by people.<br>

<h3>Expansion and Rebuild of the Reporting System at LapID</h3>
<p>For the purpose of automation of the reporting at LapID Service GmbH, I worked together with the
   DevOps to reweite and expand export queries and establish a connection from Azure in PowerBI
   such that evaluations and report generation no longer had to be done manually. Aside from that,
   the expansions to the data available made new evaluations possible that were not possible
   before.</p>

<h3>Market analysis including customer and competition analysis for Webtron GbR</h3>
<p>This project was completed as a consulting project for the Study & Consult eV, completed with
   two other members in 2023. According to a survey performed at the end of the project, the
   customer's expectations were exceeded and the results were realistic and usable.</p>

<h3>Practice Cards</h3>
<p>This is a simple web-app written with Python using Flask in addition to HTML and CSS paired with
   Bootstrap as well as pure Javascript. See the
